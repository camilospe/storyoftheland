       Stories of the Land is a land-based learning initiative that connects the learner with the natural environment of the boreal forest. 
       Trails throughout the Hannin Creek Education Centre feature markers with QR codes near plants of the boreal forest. 
       The QR code connects learners with identifying information about the plant including common name, Latin binomial name, 
       the Cree name and pronunciation and traditional Indigenous uses or culturally significant applications.
